Sample answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many clips Natalia sold in May and then add that number to the number of clips she sold in April.
In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends, so let's call this number "x".
In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, which means she sold x/2 clips.
The total number of clips sold in April and May is the sum of the clips sold in each month: x + (x/2).
We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:
x + (x/2) = (2x + x)/2 = 3x/2.
Therefore, Natalia sold 3 times as many clips in May as she did in April.
To find out how many clips she sold altogether in April and May, we multiply the number of clips sold in April by 3:
(48 * 3) = 144.
So Natalia sold a total of 144 clips altogether in April and May.

Sample answer: Let's calculate the number of each color of flower:

Yellow: 10 flowers

Purple: 80% more than yellow, so:
\( 10 + (10 \times 0.8) = 10 + 8 = 18 \) flowers

Green: 25% more than yellow and purple combined, so:
\( (10 + 18) \times (1 + 0.25) = 28 \times 1.25 = 35 \) flowers

Now let's add up all the flowers to find the total number of flowers in the garden:

Total = Yellow + Purple + Green
Total = 10 + 18 + 35
Total = 63 flowers

So Mark has 63 flowers in his garden.

Sample answer: Let's denote the number of people on the ship that was eaten by the monster in the first hundred years as \( x \). Since each subsequent ship had twice as many people as the previous one, the number of people on the second ship would be \( 2x \), the third ship would be \( 2^2x = 4x \), and so on.

The total consumption of ships over three hundred years is given as 847. This means:

\[ x + 2x + 4x + 8x + 16x + 32x + 64x + 128x + 256x = 847 \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ x(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256) = 847 \]
\[ x(2^{10} - 1) = 847 \]
\[ x(1024 - 1) = 847 \]
\[ x(1023) = 847 \]
\[ x = \frac{847}{1023} \approx 0.829 \]

Since the number of people must be an integer (you can't have half a person or more), we round down to get \( x = 0 \).

However, this doesn't make sense because you can't eat zero people! Let's re-evaluate our approach.

We need to find the value of \( x \) such that when added up correctly, the sum equals 847. Given the nature of the problem, let's consider if there might be a misunderstanding. If the correct approach involves understanding the sequence better, let’s try solving it step-by-step again but ensuring clarity.

Revised calculation:
Given:
\[ x + 2x + 4x + 8x + 16x + 32x + 64x + 128x + 256x = 847 \]

Summing the geometric series:
\[ x(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256) = 847 \]

Each term doubles after each increase:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 511 \]

So,
\[ 511x = 847 \]
\[ x = \frac{847}{511} \approx 1.63 \]

Rounding down gives us \( x = 1 \) since you cannot have less than 1 person. Therefore, the ship that was eaten by the monster in the first hundred years had approximately 1 person.

Sample answer: To calculate James's profit over 20 weeks, we need to break down the problem into steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling DVDs:
   - James sells each DVD for 2.5 times the movie cost.
   - Movie cost: $2000
   - Revenue per DVD = $2000 * 2.5

2. Calculate the daily revenue from DVD sales:
   - Daily revenue = Revenues per DVD * Number of DVDs sold per day
   - Daily revenue = (Revenue per DVD) * 500 DVDs/week

3. Calculate the weekly revenue:
   - Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 5 days/week

4. Calculate the monthly revenue:
   - Monthly revenue = Weekly revenue * 4 weeks/month

5. Calculate the annual revenue:
   - Annual revenue = Monthly revenue * 12 months/year

6. Calculate the total costs:
   - Total costs include movie production and marketing.
   - Cost of movie = $2000
   - Marketing costs = Unknown

7. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Annual revenue - Total costs

Now let's do these calculations step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling DVDs**
- Revenue per DVD = $2000 * 2.5
- Daily revenue = ($2000 * 2.5) * 500
- Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 5
- Monthly revenue = Weekly revenue * 4
- Annual revenue = Monthly revenue * 12

Let's assume the marketing costs are known or given in a different context. For now, I'll keep them unknown since they will cancel out when we add up the total costs at the end.

Given data:
- Cost of movie: $2000

We don't have enough information to determine the exact number of DVDs James makes each day or the specific marketing costs. However, the key is to know how many DVDs he makes per day to proceed with the calculations.

Assuming James makes around 1,000 DVDs per day (as an average), let's proceed with this assumption.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue**
- Daily revenue = (Cost of movie) * 500 DVDs/week
- Daily revenue = $2000 * 500 DVDs/week

Since we're not sure about the weekly and monthly revenue figures, let's use the example provided in the instructions where the marketing costs are unknown but the overall approach remains correct.

For the sake of completeness, if we assume the marketing costs are negligible compared to other expenses, the calculations remain similar to the original problem.

Let's continue with the assumptions:
- Daily revenue = $2000 * 500 DVDs/week
- Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 5 = ($2000 * 500) * 5
- Monthly revenue = Weekly revenue * 4 = ($2000 * 500 * 5) * 4

This gives us the total revenue for one week and month:
- Total weekly revenue = Monthly revenue * 4

Next, let's calculate the cost of making the DVDs:
- Total cost = $2000 + $2000 + $2000

Finally, the profit would be:
- Profit = Total weekly/revenue - Total cost

Please note that without the specific marketing costs or more detailed calculations, the final answers cannot be directly derived using the given information. If you have any additional details or can provide the actual marketing costs, we could refine our calculation further.

Sample answer: To find out how many stamps Bella bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Since she bought 11 snowflake stamps, this means she bought \(11 + 9 = 20\) truck stamps.
3. She also bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since she bought 20 truck stamps, this means she bought \(20 - 13 = 7\) rose stamps.

Now we can add up all the stamps to get the total:
- Snowflake: 11 stamps
- Truck: 20 stamps
- Rose: 7 stamps

Total number of stamps = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 stamps

So, Bella bought a total of 38 stamps.

Sample answer: To determine how many tennis balls Ralph missed hitting, we need to calculate the number of balls he successfully hit from each set and subtract these from the total.

First, let's calculate the number of balls Ralph hit from the first 100 balls:
\[
\text{Number of balls hit} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of balls Ralph hit from the next 75 balls:
\[
\text{Number of balls hit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25
\]

Now, we add the number of balls he hit from both sets to get the total number of balls he hit:
\[
\text{Total balls hit} = 40 + 25 = 65
\]

Finally, we subtract this total from the initial number of balls to find out how many were missed:
\[
\text{Total balls} = 175
\]
\[
\text{Balls missed} = 175 - 65 = 110
\]

Therefore, Ralph missed hitting \boxed{110} balls.

Sample answer: To solve this problem, let's break down the distribution of pizza slices:

- Each person initially has 4 pieces.
- Bill and Dale each eat 2 out of their 4 pieces (since they ate 50%), so together they eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pieces.
- Ann and Cate each eat 1 piece (since they ate 75%), so together they eat \(1 \times 1 = 1\) piece.

Now, let's add up all the pieces eaten:
\[4 (Bill + Dale) + 1 (Ann + Cate) = 5\]

Since there were originally 4 pieces per person and we have 5 pieces eaten, the number of uneaten pieces is:
\[4 - 5 = -1\]

However, since we cannot have negative uneaten pieces, it seems there might be an error or misunderstanding in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate by considering the total pieces available before any are eaten.

Each pizza has 4 pieces, and we know that 4 people ate 8 pieces (2 from Bill and Dale, 1 from Ann and Cate). This leaves us with:
\[4 \text{ (pieces)} - 8 \text{ (eaten)} = 0\]

So, after eating, there are no uneaten pieces left. The correct answer should be:
\[0\]

Sample answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students got a final grade of B or better (above 80%). Since 40% of his students got a grade below B, the remaining percentage is 100% - 40% = 60%.

If there are 60 students in total, then:

\[ \text{Number of students who got a B or better} = 60\% \times 60 \]

\[ = 0.60 \times 60 \]

\[ = 36 \]

So, 36 students got a final grade of B or better.

Since these 36 students made up 60% of the Grade 5 population, we can find the number of students in Grade 5 who did not get a B or better by subtracting the 36 from 60:

\[ \text{Students who did not get a B or better} = 60\% - 36\% \]

\[ = 24\% \]

Now, since each student who did not get a B or better gets a grade of C or lower, the number of students who got a final grade of B or better is equal to the percentage of students who did not get a B or better, which is 24%.

Therefore, the number of students who got a final grade of B or higher is 24.

Sample answer: To calculate how much Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to consider both the base cost of the tickets and the discounted price for any excess tickets.

The base cost per ticket is $40, so for 12 tickets:

\[ \text{Base Cost} = 12 \times \$40 = \$480 \]

For each additional ticket over 10, there's a 5% discount on that ticket. Since he bought 12 tickets, this would apply to two extra tickets (since \(12 - 10 = 2\)).

Let's calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount per extra ticket} = 2 \times (\$40 \times 5\%) = 2 \times \$40 \times 0.05 = \$4 \]

So, the total discount for these two extra tickets is:
\[ \text{Total Discount} = 2 \times \$4 = \$8 \]

Now let's subtract the discount from the base cost to get the total amount Mr. Benson paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \$480 - \$8 = \$472 \]

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid $472 in total for the 12 concert tickets.

Sample answer: To determine how many chores Gerald needs to do each month to save up for his baseball supplies, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Gerald needs to save:
   - Gerald spends $100 per month on baseball supplies.
   - His season is 4 months long.
   - Total cost = $100/month * 4 months = $400.

2. Determine how much money Gerald has already saved from his chores:
   - He saves $10 for each chore done during the time he isn't playing baseball.
   - Over 3 months (since there are 4 months in a season), he saves $10/week * 4 weeks/month * 3 months = $120.

3. Subtract the amount saved from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to save:
   - Amount left to save = $400 - $120 = $280.

4. Divide the remaining amount by the number of months he hasn’t played baseball to find the average monthly savings needed:
   - Average monthly savings required = $280 / 3 months ≈ $93.33 per month.

5. Divide this by the number of months he plays baseball to find the average number of chores per month:
   - Average chores per month = $93.33 / $10 ≈ 9.33 chores per month.

Since Gerald cannot do a fraction of a chore, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Gerald needs to average approximately 9 chores per month.

Sample answer: To find out what percentage of flowers are not roses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers.
2. Subtract the number of roses from the total to get the number of non-rosy flowers.
3. Divide that by the total number of flowers (excluding roses).
4. Convert that fraction to a percentage.

Let's start with step 1:
Total number of flowers = Roses + Tulips + Daisies
= 25 + 40 + 35
= 100

Now for step 2:
Non-rosy flowers = Total flowers - Number of roses
= 100 - 25
= 75

For step 3:
Percentage of non-rosy flowers = (Number of non-rosy flowers / Total number of flowers) * 100%
= (75 / 100) * 100%
= 0.75 * 100%
= 75%

Therefore, 75% of the flowers are not roses.

First, let's calculate the number of games Jerry has:
\[ \text{Number of games} = \text{Number of daughters} \times \text{Number of daughters per game} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Each game takes 2 hours to play, so:
\[ \text{Time per game} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total game time} = 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the practice times:
\[ \text{Practice per game} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total practice time} = 16 \times 4 = 64 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add all these together:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Game time} + \text{Practice time} = 32 + 64 = 96 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jerry will spend **96** hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether.
