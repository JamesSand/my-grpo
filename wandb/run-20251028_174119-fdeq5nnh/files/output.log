Sample answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many clips Natalia sold in May, and then add that number to the number of clips she sold in April.

In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends.
In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, which means:
May sales = 1/2 * April sales
May sales = 1/2 * 48

Now, let's calculate May sales:

May sales = 1/2 * 48
May sales = 24 clips

Now we can add the number of clips sold in both months:

Total sales = April sales + May sales
Total sales = 48 + 24
Total sales = 72 clips

Therefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.

Sample answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of flowers of each color (yellow, purple, and green) in Mark's garden and then sum these numbers.

1. **Determine the number of purple flowers:**
   - We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers.
   - If there are 10 yellow flowers, then the number of purple flowers is:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple flowers} = 10 + 0.8 \times 10 = 10 + 8 = 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of green flowers:**
   - There are only 25% as many green flowers as yellow and purple flowers combined.
   - First, find the total number of yellow and purple flowers:
     \[
     \text{Total yellow and purple flowers} = 10 + 18 = 28
     \]
   - Then, calculate the number of green flowers:
     \[
     \text{Number of green flowers} = 0.25 \times 28 = 7
     \]

3. **Sum the number of all colored flowers:**
   - Add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers together:
     \[
     \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 (\text{yellow}) + 18 (\text{purple}) + 7 (\text{green})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of flowers} = 25
     \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is 25.

Sample answer: To determine how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of people on the ship that the monster eats in the first hundred years.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Each new ship has twice as many people as the previous ship, starting with one person in the first ship.
   - The first ship has \( x \) people.
   - The second ship has \( 2x \) people.
   - The third ship has \( 4x \) people.

   Therefore, after three ships, the total number of people is:
   \[
   x + 2x + 4x = 7x
   \]

3. **Determine the Number of Ships:**
   Given that ships have been built over time, let’s denote the number of ships by \( n \). Since each ship is built at least twice as large as the previous one, the number of ships must increase linearly:
   \[
   2^2 = 4, \quad 2^3 = 8, \quad 2^n = 200 \text{ (since 847 / 4 = 211.75)}
   \]
   However, since we can't have half-ships, we assume the sequence continues as \( 2^{n+1} \).

4. **Find the Total Population After Three Ships:**
   If there are \( n \) ships, then the total population is:
   \[
   x + 2x + 4x + 8x + \ldots + 2^{n+1}x
   \]
   This is an infinite geometric series where each term increases by 2:
   \[
   x(1 + 2 + 4 + \ldots + 2^{n+1})
   \]

5. **Sum of the Geometric Series:**
   The sum of an infinite geometric series \( a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots \) is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
   \]
   Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( r = 2 \):
   \[
   x \left(\frac{1}{1 - 2}\right) = x \left(\frac{1}{-1}\right) = -x
   \]

6. **Relate the Sum to the First Hundred Years' Population:**
   We know the total population is 847, so:
   \[
   x(-x) = 847
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   -x^2 = 847
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = -847
   \]

Since this result does not make sense in the context of human populations being negative, we need to re-evaluate our approach. The correct interpretation should be that the total population exceeds 847 by some multiple of 847.

Given that the problem implies the total exceeds 847 by a certain amount, we adjust our understanding:
\[
x + 2x + 4x + \ldots + 2^{n+1}x > 847
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
7x > 847
\]
\[
x > \frac{847}{7}
\]
\[
x > 121
\]

Thus, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is more than 121 but less than or equal to 847.

Therefore, the maximum possible value for \( x \) that fits all conditions (as per logical constraints) would be:
\[
\boxed{121}
\]

Sample answer: Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling Movies:**
   - James makes $2.50 per DVD.
   - He sells 500 movies per day.
   - He sells these DVDs over 5 days a week.
   - In one week, there are 7 days.

   So, total revenue per week = \(500 \times 5 \times 6 = \$15,000\).

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the costs from the revenue.

3. **Cost of Making DVDs:**
   - It takes 6 dollars to make each DVD.

4. **Revenue from Selling DVDs:**
   - Total revenue per week from selling DVDs = \(15,000 \times 6 = \$90,000\).

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Making DVDs
     - Profit = \(90,000 - (6 \times 15,000) = 90,000 - 90,000 = \$0\).

Therefore, the total profit is $0.

James makes no profit on his movie empire.

Sample answer: To determine the total number of stamps Bella bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp she purchased and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
   \[
   \text{Number of snowflake stamps} = 11
   \]

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Since she bought 11 snowflake stamps:
   \[
   \text{Number of truck stamps} = 11 + 9 = 20
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since she bought 20 truck stamps:
   \[
   \text{Number of rose stamps} = 20 - 13 = 7
   \]

4. **Total Number of Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of stamps} = 11 (\text{snowflake}) + 20 (\text{truck}) + 7 (\text{rose})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of stamps} = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38

Sample answer: To determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to calculate the number of balls he managed to hit and subtract this from the total number of balls.

First, let's find out how many balls Ralph hit initially:
\[ \text{Number of initial balls} = 175 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of initial balls hit} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Calculate the number of balls hit initially:
\[ \text{Balls hit initially} = 175 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ \text{Balls hit initially} = 175 \times 0.4 \]
\[ \text{Balls hit initially} = 70 \]

Next, let's find out how many balls Ralph hit after the second group:
\[ \text{Number of balls after second group} = 175 - 70 \]
\[ \text{Balls after second group} = 105 \]

Now, let's find out how many balls Ralph hit out of the next group:
\[ \text{Number of balls hit out of next group} = 75 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of next balls hit} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Calculate the number of balls hit out of the next group:
\[ \text{Balls hit out of next group} = 75 \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ \text{Balls hit out of next group} = 75 \times 0.3333 \]
\[ \text{Balls hit out of next group} = 25 \]

Finally, add the number of balls hit initially and those from the second group to get the total number of balls Ralph hit:
\[ \text{Total balls hit} = 70 + 25 \]
\[ \text{Total balls hit} = 95 \]

The total number of balls Ralph started with is:
\[ \text{Total balls} = 175 \]

Now, subtract the total number of balls hit from the total number of balls to find out how many balls were not hit:
\[ \text{Balls not hit} = 175 - 95 \]
\[ \text{Balls not hit} = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Ralph did not hit is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]

Sample answer: To determine how many pizza pieces are left uneaten, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza pieces from all four individuals.
2. Determine how many pizza pieces Bill and Dale ate.
3. Determine how many pizza pieces Ann and Cate ate.
4. Subtract the eaten pieces from the total to find out how many pieces are left uneaten.

Let's start with step 1:
- Each person buys one pizza, so there are 4 people.
- Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).

Next, let's move to step 2:
- Bill eats 50% of his pizza, which means he eats \(0.5 \times 4 = 2\) pieces.
- Dale eats 50% of his pizza, which means he eats \(0.5 \times 4 = 2\) pieces.
- So, Bill and Dale together eat \(2 + 2 = 4\) pieces.

Now, let's proceed to step 3:
- Ann eats 75% of her pizza, which means she eats \(0.75 \times 4 = 3\) pieces.
- Cate eats 75% of her pizza, which means she eats \(0.75 \times 4 = 3\) pieces.
- So, Ann and Cate together eat \(3 + 3 = 6\) pieces.

Finally, for step 4:
- We subtract the total number of pieces eaten by Bill, Dale, Ann, and Cate from the total number of pieces originally available: \(16 - (4 + 6) = 16 - 10 = 6\).

Therefore, the number of pizza pieces left uneaten is \(\boxed{6}\).

2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find the number of students who got a final grade of B and above.

First, let's calculate the number of students who received a final grade below B. We know that 40% of the 60 students got a final grade below B. So, we can find 40% of 60 by multiplying 60 by 0.40 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

\[
\text{Number of students who got a final grade below B} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24
\]

Next, we subtract the number of students who received a final grade below B from the total number of students to find the number of students who got a final grade of B and above.

\[
\text{Number of students who got a final grade of B and above} = 60 - 24 = 36

Sample answer: To determine how much Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tickets Mr. Benson bought that qualify for the discount.
2. Determine the price of each discounted ticket.
3. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of discounted tickets by the price per discounted ticket.

First, let's find out how many tickets Mr. Benson bought that qualify for the discount. Since he bought 12 tickets but only needs to buy up to 10, he qualifies for a 5% discount on 10 tickets:
\[ 10 \times (1 - 0.05) = 10 \times 0.95 = 9.5 \]
Since he can't buy half a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so he buys 9 tickets.

Next, we calculate the price of each discounted ticket. Each ticket originally costs $40, and there is a 5% discount on each ticket:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.05) = 40 \times 0.95 = 38 \]
So, the price of each discounted ticket is $38.

Now, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of discounted tickets by the price per discounted ticket:
\[ 9 \times 38 = 342 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mr. Benson paid is \(\boxed{342}\).

- The cost of the Snickers is \(3 \text{ bags} \times \$5/\text{bag} = 3 \times 5 = \$15\).
- The cost of the Skittles is \(5 \text{ bags} \times \$7/\text{bag} = 5 \times 7 = \$35\).

Next, we add up the costs of the treats:
\[36 + 15 + 35 = 86.\]

Now, we add the cost of the unicorn piñata to the total cost of the treats:

Sample answer: To determine how many chores Gerald needs to do per month to save up for his baseball supplies, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Gerald will spend on baseball supplies over the course of the season.
2. Determine how much money Gerald will have saved from doing chores during the time he has free to do them.
3. Find out how much more money he needs to save compared to what he has already saved.
4. Calculate how many months he needs to work to earn the remaining savings.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Gerald will spend on baseball supplies:
\[
100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Gerald will have saved from doing chores during the time he has free to do them. Since he saves $10 for each chore and he plays baseball for 4 months, the number of chores he completes is:
\[
4 \text{ months} \div 4 \text{ months/chores} = 1 \text{ chores per month}
\]
So, he earns $10 per month by doing chores. Therefore, the total amount of money he will have saved from doing chores is:
\[
1 \text{ chore} \times \$10/\text{chose} = \$10
\]

Now, we need to find out how many months he needs to work to earn the remaining $400 (the cost of the supplies) after he has saved $10 so far:
\[
\$400 - \$10 = \$390
\]
Since he earns $10 per month, the number of months he needs to work is:
\[
\$390 \div \$10/\text{month} = 39 \text{ months}
\]

Therefore, Gerald needs to do an average of 39 chores per month to save up enough money for his supplies. The final answer is:

2. Subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers to get the number of non-rosé flowers.
3. Calculate the percentage of non-rose flowers out of the total number of flowers.

Let's start with step 1:
The total number of flowers is the sum of the number of roses, tulips, and daisies.
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of tulips} + \text{Number of daisies} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 25 + 40 + 35 = 100 \]

Next, for step 2:
We subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers to find the number of non-rusé flowers.
\[ \text{Number of non-rusé flowers} = \text{Total number of flowers} - \text{Number of roses} \]
\[ \text{Number of non-rusé flowers} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Finally, for step 3:
We calculate the percentage of non-rusé flowers out of the total number of flowers.
\[ \text{Percentage of non-rusé flowers} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of non-rusé flowers}}{\text{Total number of flowers}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of non-rusé flowers} = \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) \times 100 = 75\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of flowers that are not roses is \(\boxed{75}\).

2. Determine the total number of hours spent practicing.
3. Add the total hours from step 2 to the total hours from step 1.

First, let's calculate the total number of games played by both daughters. Since each daughter has 8 games and there are 2 daughters, the total number of games is:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Jerry spends watching the daughters play. Each game lasts 2 hours, so the total number of hours spent playing is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the total hours spent practicing to the total hours spent watching the daughters play. Each team practices 4 hours per game, and since there are 8 games each daughter plays, the total number of hours spent practicing is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ hours} \]
Adding this to the hours spent playing gives:

- Each slice of toast costs £1.
- Therefore, the cost for the toast is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

- Dale also had 2 eggs.
- Each egg costs £3.
- Therefore, the cost for the eggs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Adding the costs together, the total cost for Dale's breakfast is \(2 + 6 = 8\) pounds.

Next, let's calculate Andrew's breakfast:
- Andrew had 1 slice of toast.
- Each slice of toast costs £1.
- Therefore, the cost for the toast is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) pound.

- Andrew also had 2 eggs.
- Each egg costs £3.
- Therefore, the cost for the eggs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Adding the costs together, the total cost for Andrew's breakfast is \(1 + 6 = 7\) pounds.

3. Calculate the total number of cans Jennifer bought by adding the initial amount she bought to the additional cans she bought.

First, we know that Mark purchased 50 cans of milk. According to the problem, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. So, we need to find out how many sets of 5 cans Mark bought and then multiply that by 6.

The number of sets of 5 cans Mark bought is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]
Since Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for each set of 5 cans Mark bought, we multiply 10 by 6:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Next, we add this result to the initial 40 cans Jennifer bought to find out the total number of cans she brought home:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

2. Use the information given to find the ages of Jolyn and Leon.
3. Calculate the difference in their ages.

First, let's denote the age of Aivo as \( x \) months. According to the problem:
- Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, so Therese's age is \( x + 5 \) months.
- Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, so Jolyn's age is \( (x + 5) + 2 = x + 7 \) months.
- Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, so Leon's age is \( x \).

Now, we know the ages of Jolyn, Therese, and Leon:
- Jolyn's age: \( x + 7 \) months.
- Therese's age: \( x + 5 \) months.
- Leon's age: \( x \) months.

The problem asks how much older Jolyn is compared to Leon. To find this, we subtract Leon's age from Jolyn's age:

First, let's calculate the total amount of bird food Herman feeds per day:
- In December, he feeds the birds \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup in the morning and \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup in the afternoon. Therefore, each day he feeds \(1 + 1 = 2\) cups.
- In January, he feeds the birds \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup in the morning and \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup in the afternoon. Therefore, each day he feeds \(1 + 1 = 2\) cups.
- In February, he feeds the birds \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup in the morning and \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup in the afternoon. Therefore, each day he feeds \(1 + 1 = 2\) cups.

Next, we calculate the daily total for all three months:
- For December: \(30 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 60 \text{ cups}\).
- For January: \(31 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 62 \text{ cups}\).
- For February: \(28 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 56 \text{ cups}\).

Now, we add up the daily totals for all three months:
\[60 \text{ cups} + 62 \text{ cups} + 56 \text{ cups} = 178 \text{ cups}\]

Therefore, Herman will need \(\boxed{178}\) cups of food for all three months.

2. **Determine the number of nickels Alice will receive:**
   Since Alice exchanges her quarters for nickels, she will get nickels equal to the number of quarters.
   \[
   \text{Number of nickels} = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of iron nickels:**
   20% of the nickels are iron nickels. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of iron nickels} = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]

4. **Determine the value of the iron nickels:**
   Each nickel is worth $3. So, the value of the 4 iron nickels is:
   \[
   \text{Value of iron nickels} = 4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the total value of the remaining nickels:**
   Subtract the value of the iron nickels from the total value of the nickels. The total value of the nickels is 20 nickels each worth $1 (since 20 nickels amount to $20), but we don't need this information for the final calculation as it cancels out.
   \[
   \text{Total value of nickels} = 20 \times 1 = 20
   \]

6. **Add the value of the iron nickels to the total value of the nickels:**
   \[
   \text{Total value of Alice's money} = 20 + 12 = 32
   \]

Thus, the total value of Alice's money now is \(\boxed{32}\).

Sample answer: To determine how many sales were in the stationery section, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of sales.
2. Determine the number of sales in each section based on the given ratios.
3. Calculate the number of sales in the stationery section.

We know from the problem that the total number of sales is 36. According to the problem, the craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. Let's calculate each part step by step.

First, we calculate the number of sales in the fabric section:
\[
\text{Sales in the fabric section} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

Next, we calculate the number of sales in the jewelry section:
\[
\text{Sales in the jewelry section} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Now, we add the sales from both sections to find out how many sales were in the stationery section:
\[
\text{Sales in the stationery section} = 12 + 9 = 21
\]

Therefore, the number of sales in the stationery section is \boxed{21}.

Sample answer: To determine the total number of goats that Paddington and Washington have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of goats Washington has.
2. Calculate the number of goats Paddington has by adding 40 to the number of goats Washington has.
3. Add the number of goats Washington has to the number of goats Paddington has.

First, we know that Washington has 140 goats. According to the problem, Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goats Paddington has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of goats Paddington has} = 140 + 40 = 180 \]

Next, we add the number of goats Washington has to the number of goats Paddington has to find the total number of goats:
\[ \text{Total number of goats} = 140 + 180 = 320 \]

Thus, the total number of goats is \(\boxed{320}\).

Sample answer: To determine how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candy bars Tina sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from Marvin's sales.
3. Determine the total revenue from Tina's sales.
4. Find the difference in revenue between Tina and Marvin.

First, we know that Marvin sold 35 candy bars. Since Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin, we calculate the number of candy bars Tina sold as follows:
\[
3 \times 35 = 105
\]
So, Tina sold 105 candy bars.

Next, we calculate the revenue from Marvin's sales. Each candy bar costs $2, so the revenue from Marvin is:
\[
35 \times 2 = 70
\]

Then, we calculate the revenue from Tina's sales. Since each candy bar costs $2, the revenue from Tina is:
\[
105 \times 2 = 210
\]

Finally, we find out how much more money Tina made by subtracting the revenue from Marvin from the revenue from Tina:
\[
210 - 70 = 140
\]

Therefore, Tina made \(\boxed{140}\) dollars more than Marvin.
