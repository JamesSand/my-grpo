Sample answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many clips Natalia sold in May, and then add that number to the number of clips she sold in April.

In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends.
In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, which means:
May sales = 1/2 * April sales
May sales = 1/2 * 48

Now, let's calculate May sales:

May sales = 1/2 * 48
May sales = 24 clips

Now we can add the number of clips sold in both months:

Total sales = April sales + May sales
Total sales = 48 + 24
Total sales = 72 clips

Therefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.

Sample answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of flowers of each color (yellow, purple, and green) in Mark's garden and then sum these numbers.

1. **Determine the number of purple flowers:**
   - We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers.
   - If there are 10 yellow flowers, then the number of purple flowers is:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple flowers} = 10 + 0.8 \times 10 = 10 + 8 = 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of green flowers:**
   - There are only 25% as many green flowers as yellow and purple flowers combined.
   - First, find the total number of yellow and purple flowers:
     \[
     \text{Total yellow and purple flowers} = 10 + 18 = 28
     \]
   - Then, calculate the number of green flowers:
     \[
     \text{Number of green flowers} = 0.25 \times 28 = 7
     \]

3. **Sum the number of all colored flowers:**
   - Add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers together:
     \[
     \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 (\text{yellow}) + 18 (\text{purple}) + 7 (\text{green})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of flowers} = 25
     \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is 25.
